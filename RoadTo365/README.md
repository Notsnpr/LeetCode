# Leetcode Journey

## The Best Time to Start is Now

> "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now."

I might not have started on January 1st, but I am starting now. For the next year, I will dedicate myself to solving Leetcode problems consistently, improving my problem-solving skills, and growing as a developer.

### Goals
- **Consistency:** Solve problems regularly.
- **Growth:** Strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- **Reflection:** Track my progress and learn from mistakes.

### Progress
Check my progress as I tackle various problems throughout the year in the solutions folder.

Let the journey begin!
